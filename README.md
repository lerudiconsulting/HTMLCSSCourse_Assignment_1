# HTML CSS Course Assignment 1
Assignment 1 of the HMTL and CSS course. The idea of this course was to: Create a personal portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS, introducing more advanced CSS elements.

The details of the task 
- Develop a well-structured HTML document using HTML5 structural elements.
- Use standard HTML tags, including paragraphs, headings, lists, and tables.
- Include a personal image with proper alt text and at least two other relevant images.
- Create an detailed section about yourself with sub-sections: biography, academic interests or hobbies, and future goals.
- Implement a navigation bar linking to main sections and an external page (e.g., social media).
- Create a simple HTML form for visitors to send messages (using the mailto: function in the action attribute).
- Style the webpage using external CSS, focusing on layout (flexbox or grid), typography, and color schemes.
- Design hover and focus effects for interactive elements like links or buttons.
- Ensure responsive design using media queries for desktop and mobile views.
- Add a footer with contact information, a copyright notice, and placeholders for privacy policy and terms of service.

## Method
Implementation of the assignment was done by hand trying to keep the structure simple and clean using only pure HTML5, CSS and Javascript. The addition of libraries such as Bootstrap or Material UI would have simplified the task significantly when it comes to design, but the excercise as such gives more in terms of learning when done without such libraries.

## Reflections
The challenge in itself seemed pretty straightforward. I elaborated it slightly to include javascript so as to switch visibility for the various sections. Adding this visual switch improved on the base task feature visually slightly to give it a bit of effect.

### Biography section
The biography section consists of a division of the layout using a table, where two columns divide the text and images horizontally. The text is divided into two paragraphs 
and the image has rounded corners and a fixed width and an adaptive height.

### Academic section
The academic section contains text in a paragraph as well as 4 images that are floating in a horizontal fastion with rounded corners and margins

### Hobbies and Future goals section
The hobbies section contains text an a paragraph as well as a bullet point list

### Contact section
The contact section contains a form with labels, input fields and a submit button wrapped in a form
